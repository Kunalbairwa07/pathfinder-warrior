🚩 What is this?
This web application helps you understand and see how classic shortest path algorithms work. The interface is interactive and easy to use, letting you try algorithms like Dijkstra, A*, BFS, DFS, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall.

💡 Basic Features
Visualize popular algorithms (Dijkstra, A*, BFS, DFS, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall)

Choose your start and end points on a grid

Watch the algorithm step-by-step finding the shortest route

Live Demo Map: Select two city addresses on a mini-map and see the shortest real-world route

Grid editing: Add/remove walls, reset, and customize as needed
